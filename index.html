            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

    <div class="box2">Your ideas will have more value 
        By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.
        </div>
    <div class="box3">Design solutions with love 
        Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
        </div>
    <div class="box4">Share and show your work 
        As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.

        Find your problem 
        It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to your surroundings.
